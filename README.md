# ISS Fly Over Time

Pretty straight forward script that will return the total number of passes a user requests given their geographical location. This script will require your own Geocode key from Google.

If you do not have a Geocode API key from Google, please follow the instructions as outlined here:

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key


Once obtained you will need to modify they key value in the parameters variable within the def GetLatLng().


Code clean-up to come (this was my very first piece of code written... )
